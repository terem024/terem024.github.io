<h3>My Background and Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I’m John Marie Diogracias, currently a 3rd-year BSIT student with interests spanning software development, computer hardware, and cybersecurity.
            I’ve worked on academic projects such as a hotel reservation system and a campus-wide room reservation platform, gaining hands-on experience in system design and problem solving.
            Alongside academics, I hold a TESDA NCII certification in computer hardware servicing and have practical knowledge in troubleshooting PCs, cases, and UPS units.
            Looking forward, I’m focused on building a career as a cybersecurity analyst or ethical hacker, where I can apply my technical foundation to real-world security challenges.
            Outside of IT, I train in calisthenics and running, which fuel my discipline and determination. I also enjoy gaming, especially games like Honkai Star Rail and Wuthering Waves, which inspire creativity and strategy in my downtime.
